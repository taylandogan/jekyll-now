title: Losing Your Genuine Self

On the first day of my job, **Aug 5th 2014** to be exact, which also happens to be the starting point of my first working experience in a.. **ehem**..*“professional”* environment,  I gave myself a promise:

*“I will not become that person who hates his/her job..someone absorbed by corporate life so much that he/she becomes a soulless person.”*

**Reader:** *“Wow, this is kinda childish.. Is this actually a line from a shounen anime haha..”*

<div style="text-align:center" markdown="1">

<!-- Me tbh* -->
</div>

Sooo.. this idea struck me recently. I truly feel like **I’m losing my genuine self** and it feels **awful**. :( Yesterday I caught myself behaving unnecessarily impatient and aggressive about some issue.. I immediately tried to rollback to *“real me”*, but this whole thing got me **perplexed**.

That was not me.. such an attitude was not **constructive**, not at all. Why would I stress about something that is so insignificant? It is just a task after all..

I don’t know. Maybe it is disgusting office politics, maybe it is due to my manager’s invasive and abusive attitudes, maybe it is being *“professional”* as Linus Torvalds himself explained [here](https://marc.info/?l=linux-kernel&m=137392506516022&w=2).

I am not happy, and I think I have legitimate reasons for that. For example, why would some group of people, who are on the higher steps of hierarchy, decide to hire someone after testing his/her skills and then do not let them do anything without their approval ?

**…*crickets chirp*…**

 I honestly cannot **comprehend**.

**Reader:** *“Aaaah.. The good old micromanagement..”*

**_\*Darth Sidious voice\*_** Yeeees.. But let’s talk about that later.

Soooooooo..I feel like my creativity is slowly being extinguished and I’m losing my authentic self. I need to find a new job that is much more employee-friendly and **humane**.
