Let's get to the point immediately. I have postponed this enough.
It's been 11 days. **11/365 is already gone**, and what have I done?! not much..

<!-- THE TRUTH ABOUT RESOLUTIONS -->
</div>

**Here are some of the things I want to accomplish in 2018:**
+ GET YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE!
+ Build a prototype of Kogo project and integrate it into your life.
+ IoT stuff! Do some DIY or something and just learn that shit.
+ Get better at drawing, and try getting into oil painting.
+ Learn at least 4 skateboard tricks.
+ Read at least 8 books. [Mass Effect Retribution, Elon Musk Bio, The Alchemist, ..]
+ Draw 3-4 web comics and post them on this blog.
+ Implement a neural network from scratch.
+ Do at least 4 DIY projects.


"Happy fucking new year."
